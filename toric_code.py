:param size:

 We define the unit cell, which contains two qubits, a star operator and plaquette operator.

    |       |
- Star  -  Q_0 -     also top (T) qubit
    |       |
-  Q_1  - Plaq  -    also down (D) qubit
    |       |

By doing so, we can define arrays the star and plaquette operators, where their index value define their position
  on the qubit lattice. For the qubit array, there is an extra dimension to store the two qubits per unit cell.

self.array stores the qubit values and has dimension [XZ_error{0,1}, Top_down{0,1}, size, size]
Qubit values are either 0 or 1, which is analogous to the -1, and 1 state, respectively
