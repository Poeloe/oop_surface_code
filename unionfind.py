        Recursive function which first grows a cluster's children and then itself.

        There are two distinct growth steps. 1) first half step from a given vertex, the cluster size does not increase, no new edges or vertices are added to the cluster, except for during a merge. 2) second half step in which a new vertex is reached, and the edge is added to the cluster.
        During the inital {find_clusters} function, the initial boundary, which contains edges ready for growth step 1, are added to {full_bound}. {half_bound} which contains the boundary edges for growth step 2, is yet empty. From here, clusters from even buckets go into growth step 1 on edges from {full_bound}, and clusters from uneven buckets go into growth step 2 on edges from "half_bound". New boundary edges are added to the other boundary list.
        After growth, the cluster is placed into a new bucket using {cluster_place_bucket}. If a merge happens, the root cluster of the current cluster is made a child of the pendant root_cluster. And the pendant root cluster is placed in a new bucket instead.
        If a cluster has children, these clusters are grown first. The new boundaries from these child clusters are appended to the root_cluster. Such that a parent does not need to remember its children.
