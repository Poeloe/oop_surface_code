The recursiveness of the function makes sure that at each level the parent is pointed towards the root cluster, furfilling the collapsing rule.

    Recursive function which adds all connected erasure edges to a cluster, or finds the boundary on a vertex.

    For a given vertex, this function finds the neighboring edges and vertices that are in the the currunt cluster. Any new vertex or edge will be added to the graph.
    If the newly found edge is part of the erasure, the edge and the corresponding vertex will be added to the cluster, and the function is started again on the new vertex. Otherwise it will be added to the boundary.
    If a vertex is an anyon, its property and the parity of the cluster will be updated accordingly.
